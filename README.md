## Roadmap

### Phase 1: EVM on Testnet Development
In this phase, we will focus on developing and testing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) integration on the testnet. This will involve building the necessary infrastructure and smart contracts to enable secure and efficient savings operations.

### Phase 2: Cosmos Chain Integration
The second phase of development will revolve around integrating GTSave with the Cosmos blockchain. By leveraging the power of the Cosmos ecosystem, we aim to enhance cross-chain interoperability and expand the platform's capabilities.

### Phase 3: Mainnet Launch
The final phase of development will culminate in the launch of GTSave on the mainnet. Users will be able to securely save and earn rewards by participating in exciting and fair drawings on multiple supported networks, enjoying the benefits of decentralization and transparency.

We are committed to continuous improvement and will regularly update the roadmap to incorporate new features, network integrations, and community feedback.
