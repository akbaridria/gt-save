# GTSave

## Description
GTSave is a decentralized savings protocol built on the powerful combination of Axelar GMP and API3 QRNG. It empowers users to save and earn rewards by participating in fair and transparent drawings on the platform. GTSave integrates with various blockchain networks, providing a secure and exciting experience for users.

## Project Website
Visit our [website](https://gtsave.web.app) to learn more about GTSave and explore the platform.

## Underlying Technology
GTSave leverages the following cutting-edge technologies:

- **Axelar GMP (Global Messaging Protocol):** A decentralized cross-chain communication protocol that enables seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks.
- **API3 QRNG:** A secure and verifiable source of randomness used for ensuring fairness and transparency in various smart contract applications.
- **Moonbeam Precompiles Batch:** We use Precompiles Batch on moonbeam when user want to deposit to gtsave to combine approve + deposit into a single transaction.

## Yield Source
GTSave utilizes Moonwell Artemis on Moonbeam as the yield source for generating rewards. Moonwell Artemis provides a robust and secure lending and borrowing protocol, ensuring efficient capital utilization and generating interest for GTSave users.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: EVM on Testnet Development
In this phase, we will focus on developing and testing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) integration on the testnet. This will involve building the necessary infrastructure and smart contracts to enable secure and efficient savings operations.

### Phase 2: Cosmos Chain Integration
The second phase of development will revolve around integrating GTSave with the Cosmos blockchain. By leveraging the power of the Cosmos ecosystem, we aim to enhance cross-chain interoperability and expand the platform's capabilities.

### Phase 3: Mainnet Launch
The final phase of development will culminate in the launch of GTSave on the mainnet. Users will be able to securely save and earn rewards by participating in exciting and fair drawings on multiple supported networks, enjoying the benefits of decentralization and transparency.

We are committed to continuous improvement and will regularly update the roadmap to incorporate new features, network integrations, and community feedback.
